## 1. Installation
Before starting with the project setup, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:
- Brownie: To install Brownie, run `pip install eth-brownie` in your terminal.
- Ganache CLI: To install Ganache CLI, run `npm install -g ganache-cli` in your terminal.

Once you have installed the dependencies, proceed with the following steps:

1. Create a folder named "Voting" on your system.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the "Voting" folder.
3. Run the command `brownie init` in your terminal. This command will create the necessary folders and files to start your solidity project.

## 2. Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Write your solidity contracts in the "contracts" folder created by the Brownie initialization command.
2. Compile your contracts by running the command `brownie compile` in your terminal. This will generate the necessary bytecode and ABI files.
3. Write tests for your contracts in the "tests" folder. You can run the tests using the command `brownie test` in your terminal.
4. Deploy your contracts to a local blockchain using Ganache CLI. Start Ganache CLI by running the command `ganache-cli` in a separate terminal window. Then, deploy your contracts using the command `brownie run scripts/deploy.py`.
5. Interact with your deployed contracts using Brownie's interactive console. Run the command `brownie console` in your terminal to access the console. From there, you can call functions and interact with your contracts.

## 3. Configuration
No additional configuration steps are required for this project.
